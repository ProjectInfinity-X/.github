Here are some points to note while applying the official maintainership :-

- Your device sources must be public, exceptions could be followed but the team eye must to be kept. However kernel source must be fully publically pushed as per GPL requirements..
- You must have proper resources (server/local machine) to build. It should always be your headache to arrange one. Team won't be providing any help/jenkins.
- Respect the commit history and maintain proper authorships.
